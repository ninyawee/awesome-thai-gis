# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an awesome-list style repository containing curated links to GIS (Geographic Information System) resources for Thailand. The repository is primarily documentation-based with no code to build or test.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of:
- `README.md` - The main document containing all GIS resources organized into sections
- `LICENSE` - MIT license file
- No executable code or build processes

## Content Organization

The README.md is organized into the following sections:
1. **Static Map Data** - Downloadable datasets with infrequent updates
2. **Dynamic Map Data** - Real-time or regularly updated data sources  
3. **Applications** - Interactive web mapping applications
4. **Tools** - GIS data processing and visualization tools
5. **Thai GIS Companies** - Local companies providing GIS services

## Maintenance Tasks

### Adding New Resources
When adding new resources, follow the established format:
```
### [Resource Name](URL) - Brief description
- **Organization**: Entity responsible for the resource
- **Data types/Purpose**: What data is available or what the tool does
- **Coverage**: Geographic area covered
- **Update frequency**: How often the data is updated
```

### Link Verification
Links should be periodically checked for availability. Dead links should be removed to maintain the quality of the resource list.

## Important Notes

- This is a fork of the original repository by @pnphannisa
- Focus on publicly available, free resources for GIS work in Thailand
- Resources should be categorized appropriately (static data, dynamic data, or applications)
- Thai language descriptions (ภาษาไทย) can be included where appropriate
